## Objective

Project 1: Wireshark Traffic Capture and Analysis
Objective: Learn to use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, distinguishing between encrypted and unencrypted protocols. Gain hands-on experience with protocols such as RADIUS, HTTP, DNS, Telnet, HTTPS, and SSH. Learn how to decrypt HTTPS traffic using a pre-master secret key.

Project 2: Wireshark for Beginners: Capture Packets
Objective: Develop the skills of a novice security analyst by capturing and analyzing web traffic using Wireshark. Learn to set up and use Wireshark to capture, save, and filter HTTP and HTTPS packets, enhancing your understanding of client-server communications.

Project 3: Microsoft Windows Defender and Firewall for Beginners
Objective: Build essential skills to recognize common security threats and set up cybersecurity defenses using Microsoft Windows Defender and Firewall. Learn to update threat definitions, run antivirus scans, and configure firewall rules, preparing you for further cybersecurity education and entry-level IT roles.

### Skills Learned

- Locate Microsoft Windows Security Virus and Threat Protection Settings
- Run Microsoft Windows Defender Antivirus Quick Scan 
- Configure Microsoft Windows Firewall Rules
- Install and set up Wireshark on Ubuntu.
- Use a display filter to detect HTTP and HTTPS packets.
- Use a display filter to detect IP Addresses in packets.
- Troubleshoot with Wireshark, capture Traffic and analyze already captured Traffic. Use Display and Capture Filters.
- Generate, Capture and analyze RADIUS, DNS, HTTP and Telnet unencrypted Traffic. Decrypt also the RADIUS encypted password.
- Generate, Capture then analyze SSH and HTTPS encrypted Traffic. Decrypt HTTPS Traffic in Wireshark.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
